This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Deploy
[Pokedex](https://pokedex-teambuilder.vercel.app/)

## Status
Currently I have all 898 pokemon pages, and index page, generated by SSG.

## Issues
The plan was to build a basic teambuilder, but, the PokeAPI is limited in terms of what it has for moves and would require a lot of API chaining to get the desired outcomes. So I've decided to put that part on hold for now.
